There are A boxes placed in a straight line.
You have to color the boxes using B colors such that any C consecutive boxes have distinct colors.
Find and return the number of ways to color the boxes. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
NOTE: Every color should be used at least once.  

Constraints
1 <= C <= B <= A <= 1000

Input Format
First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is an integer B.
Third argument is an integer C.


Output Format
Return an integer denoting the number of ways to color the boxes.
